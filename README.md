**games.json NOTICE**

Currently, the **'games.json'** file is far too large to upload directly to GitHub (590MB conflicting with 100MB maximum upload).

This file is required to run dataProcessing.py and can be downloaded from the following link: [Steam Games Dataset: games.json](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fronkongames/steam-games-dataset?select=games.json)

Place the file within the root directory before running dataProcessing.py.


**NOTE:** The dash web server functionality is NOT dependant on the games.json file, but rather the 4 .csv files output by dataProcessing.py.
